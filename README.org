* Introduction

cl-gdata is a project aimed at implementing the Google GData API's in
Common Lisp.

Source code can be found at: https://github.com/lokedhs/cl-gdata

Web site: http://source.dhsdevelopments.com/home/cl-gdata

Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cl-gdata

* Compatilibity

cl-gdata is being developed on SBCL, but all attempts are made to keep
the code as standard as possible. That said, because of the numerous
libraries being used, not all Lisp implementations are able to load
this library.

This project is currently known to work on:

- SBCL
- CCL

It currently has problems with:

- ABCL (Does not have a functioning implementation of Closer-MOP)
- ECL (xpath does not load)
- CLISP (Fails when loading classes with a metaclass. Problems with
  the MOP implementation?)

* API Documentation

** Authenticating
All API calls requires the user to be authenticated. Google provides
several different authentication methods that can be used. The primary
ways are: [[http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/auth/overview.html#ClientLogin][ClientLogin]], [[http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/auth/overview.html#authsub][AuthSub]] and [[http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/auth/overview.html#OAuth][OAuth]].

cl-gdata supports different implementations of authentication
objects, although currently only ClientLogin is supported by means of
the =CL-GDATA-CLIENTLOGIN:CLIENTLOGIN-SESSION= class.

All functions that require authentication needs to be able to access a
session instance that is responsible for handling the authentication
process. The session can be specified using the keyword
argument :SESSION and will default to the content of
=CL-GDATA:*GDATA-SESSION*=.

*** Authenticating With ClientLogin
The ClientLogin session instance is created by instantiating the
=CL-GDATA-CLIENTLOGIN:CLIENTLOGIN-SESSION= class:

#+begin_src lisp
(setq cl-gdata:*gdata-session*
      (make-instance 'cl-gdata-clientlogin:clientlogin-session
                     :user username
                     :password password))
#+end_src

This will cause all subsequent calls to the GData functions to use
ClientLogin with the given username and password.

*** Authenticating With OAuth

The OAuth autentication model is currently under development and does
not work yet.

** Document List API

The document List API is used to access documents in Google Docs.

All symbols for this part of the API is in the CL-GDATA-DOCS-LIST
package. The examples assumes that this package is interned in the
current package.

*** Listing Documents

Listing documents is performed using the LIST-DOCUMENTS function:

#+begin_src lisp
(list-documents)
#+end_src

Running the above results in something like the following:

#+begin_src lisp
(#<DOCUMENT "word document"> #<SPREADSHEET "Test spreadsheet">
 #<DOCUMENT "Test document">)
#+end_src

*** Document Object Hierarchy

All document classes inherit from the DOCUMENT class. This itself
inherits from ATOM-FEED-ENTRY (see [[ATOM-FEED-ENTRY Class Description]]).

| Slot               | Accessor                    | Description                                                    |
|--------------------+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| id-url             | document-id-url             | The ID URL for this document                                   |
| resource-id        | document-resource-id        | The resource ID. This value uniquely identifies this document. |
| description        | document-description        | Human-readable description                                     |
| suggested-filename | document-suggested-filename | The suggested name for the file when downloaded                |
| updated            | document-updated            | The timestamp when the document was updated                    |
| content            | document-content            | List of entries, each being a list of type and source URL      |

** ATOM-FEED-ENTRY Class Description

The class ATOM-FEED-ENTRY is the superclass of all classes that
describe entries from an Atom feed. This includes all documents from
Google Docs as well as Picasa documents and Google Contacts.

The class has the following slots:

| Slot     | Accessor         | Description                                   |
|----------+------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| feeds    | feed-entry-feeds | A list of all <atom:link> elements            |
| title    | feed-entry-title | The title of the element                      |
| node-dom | node-dom         | The XML node that was read from the Atom feed |
